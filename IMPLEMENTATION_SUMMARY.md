# ATHENA — Implementation Summary

Permanent implementation log. One section per completed phase, newest first,
in the 7-part format mandated by CLAUDE.md. Written before owner review;
status updated on approval.

## Phase 1 — Data Foundation (in progress)

### M1.1 — MarketDataProvider Contracts

| | |
|---|---|
| Completed | 2026-07-20 |
| Scope | Provider Protocol behavioral contract, ProviderCapabilities/ProviderHealth invariants, reusable contract test suite |
| Tests | 67 passed / 0 failed (16 new) |
| Status | **Awaiting owner approval** — M1.2 (FileProvider) blocked until approved |
| Branch | main |

Frozen Protocol signatures untouched (contract compatibility preserved). Added: constructor invariants on `ProviderCapabilities` (non-empty unique timeframes, history ≥ 1 day) and `ProviderHealth` (mandatory detail, tz-aware timestamps); a documented behavioral contract on the Protocol (capability honesty, candle ordering/uniqueness/range, emptiness-is-not-error, determinism, unknown-id failures, structurally-forbidden order methods); `tests/contract/provider_contract.py` — the conformance suite every provider (M1.2 FileProvider, future broker adapters per DD-1) must pass unchanged, including a `test_no_order_methods_exist` structural-safety check; proven against a deterministic in-memory `StubProvider` (test infrastructure only, arithmetic data, no randomness/clock reads) plus negative tests showing the suite catches rogue order methods and invalid capabilities. Validation checklist 1–10 passed; no ADR needed; no config changes.

## Phase 0 — Foundations

| | |
|---|---|
| Completed | 2026-07-20 |
| Blueprint scope | ATHENA-002 §14, Phase 0 |
| Tests | 51 passed / 0 failed |
| Status | **APPROVED** (owner + principal engineer review passed, 2026-07-20) |
| Branch | main |
| Lessons learned | Phase-sized batches are too large to review well — milestone-based workflow adopted from Phase 1 (see CLAUDE.md, docs/MILESTONES.md) |

### 1. Summary of completed work

Project scaffolding (`pyproject.toml`, `justfile`, `.env.example`); complete canonical domain model; layered configuration framework with strategy profiles, feature flags, and cross-file invariants; JSONL logging with secret redaction and run/cycle correlation; observability skeleton (metric timers, performance-budget violations, system-health pre-flight); Trading Calendar Engine loaded with the real NSE 2026 holiday calendar (16 weekday holidays + Muhurat on 2026-11-08); CLI commands `athena today`, `athena health`, `athena version`.

### 2. Architectural compliance review

All Phase 0 exit criteria pass: CalendarContext correct for the 10 acceptance dates including Republic Day (holiday) and Muhurat (special session overriding a Sunday, timings honestly "TBD" until NSE notifies); config invariant violations fail with readable errors naming field and rule; full suite green. Contracts match the blueprint exactly: PipelineContext enforces consumes/produces discipline (re-producing a key raises, F-1/ADR-003); `MarketDataProvider` Protocol contains no order methods (ADR-002); explanations are constructor-mandatory — a TRADE decision without a TradePlan, without a direction, or with a failed quality gate cannot be instantiated (F-12, ADR-005); prices are Decimal; timestamps are timezone-aware; clocks are injected. No architectural deviations; no ADR was needed.

### 3. Files created

- `src/athena/domain/` — enums, market, evidence, decision, run, health, context, interfaces (8 files)
- `src/athena/config/` — models (pydantic), loader + snapshot hashing (2 files)
- `src/athena/observability/` — logging, metrics, health (3 files)
- `src/athena/calendar/engine.py`, `src/athena/cli.py`, `src/athena/errors.py`
- `config/` — base, market.nse, risk, capital, regime, universe, indicators, profiles/intraday-momentum, calendar/{holidays,expiries,events} (10 files)
- `tests/` — conftest + 5 test modules + golden-dataset skeleton README
- Scaffolding: `pyproject.toml`, `justfile`, `.env.example`

### 4. Tests added (51)

Calendar acceptance (10 parametrized dates, timings, trading-session semantics, budget event, fail-loud on uncovered year, determinism); config (11 cases: invariants, typo rejection, missing file, unknown profile, unversioned indicator, out-of-session trading window, snapshot hash determinism and change-sensitivity); domain invariants (immutability, impossible OHLC, naive timestamps, mandatory explanations, score-breakdown sum, decision contract, context discipline, read-only context data); observability (JSON-line shape, run/cycle correlation, secret redaction, budget violation detection, health pre-flight honest WARNs, calendar-coverage BLOCKED); CLI (5 commands/paths).

### 5. Remaining work

Phase 1 (Data): `MarketDataProvider` contract test suite, FileProvider (EOD bhavcopy + intraday files), validation layer (freshness, OHLC sanity, gaps, duplicates), corporate-actions handling, SQLite store with backup/restore. Owner actions before relying on calendar-aware features: verify `config/calendar/holidays.json` against the NSE circular and set `verified_by_owner: true`; populate `config/calendar/expiries.json` from the current derivatives circular (left empty by design — expiry weekdays change by circular and were not guessed).

### 6. Risks discovered

The AI sandbox cannot delete files, so `athena health` reports storage/logs BLOCKED when run there — the check is working as designed and passes on the owner's machine. The blueprint pins Python ≥ 3.12 but verification ran on 3.10; `pyproject.toml` currently declares ≥ 3.10 — tighten to 3.12 once the production interpreter is confirmed.

### 7. Suggested improvements (implementation-only)

A `just verify-calendar` target that diffs `holidays.json` against the NSE circular each January; a minimal GitHub Actions workflow (ruff + mypy + pytest) once the owner wants CI on pushes.

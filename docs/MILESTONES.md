# ATHENA — Milestone Roadmap

Official milestone breakdown per the milestone-based workflow (CLAUDE.md).
One milestone at a time; owner approval gates every transition. A milestone
too large for a single-sitting review is split BEFORE implementation.

## Phase 0 — Foundations ✅ APPROVED (2026-07-20)

Delivered as one batch before this workflow existed; retroactive milestone map:
M0.1 Repository & Project Setup · M0.2 Canonical Domain Model · M0.3 Configuration
Framework · M0.4 Trading Calendar · M0.5 Observability & CLI.

*Status legend: a milestone is "In review" after its Milestone Review Summary is
delivered, "Approved" only when the owner says so. Never two milestones in flight.*
